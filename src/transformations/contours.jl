"""
    contours(; levels=5, kwargs...)

Create contour lines over the grid spanned over x and y by args 1 and 2 in the `mapping`,
with height values z passed via arg 3. 

You can pass the number of levels as an integer or a vector of levels.
The levels are calculated across the whole z data if they are specified as an integer.

Note that `visual(Contour)` only works in a limited way with AlgebraOfGraphics since version 0.7,
because the internal calculations it does are not compatible with the scale system. With
`visual(Contour)`, you can only have categorically-colored contours (for example to
visualize contours of multiple categories). Alternatively, if you set the `colormap` attribute, you can get
continuously-colored contours but the levels will not be known to AlgebraOfGraphics,
so they won't be synchronized across facets and there will not be a colorbar.

All other keyword arguments are forwarded as attributes to the underlying `Contour` plot.
