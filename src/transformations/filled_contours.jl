"""
    filled_contours(; bands=automatic, levels=automatic)

Create filled contours over the grid spanned over x and y by args 1 and 2 in the `mapping`,
with height values z passed via arg 3. 

You can pass either the number of bands to `bands` or pass a vector of levels (the boundaries
of the bands) to `levels`, but not both.
The number of bands when `levels` is passed is `length(levels) - 1`.
The levels are calculated across the whole z data if the number of `bands` is specified.
If neither levels nor bands are specified, the default is `bands = 10`.

Note that `visual(Contourf)` does not work with AlgebraOfGraphics since version 0.7,
because the internal binning it does is not compatible with the scale system.
