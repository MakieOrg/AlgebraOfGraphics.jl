# Secondary scales

By default, scales with the same aesthetic type have their categories merged.
This can be undesirable if there are disjoint sets of categories, for example
three different time series with two different event markers:

````@example secondary_scales
nevents = 500
ngroups = 3
time = repeat(1:nevents, ngroups)
y = reduce(vcat, [cumsum(randn(length(time))) for _ in 1:ngroups])
group = repeat(["A", "B", "C"], inner = nevents)
df1 = (; time, y, group)
df2 = (; time = [30, 79, 250, 400], event = ["X", "Y", "Y", "X"])

spec_a = data(df1) * mapping(:time, :y, color = :group) * visual(Lines)
spec_b = data(df2) * mapping(:time, color = :event) * visual(VLines)

draw(spec_a + spec_b)
````

By assigning an arbitrary `scale` identifier to one of the color mappings, we can
split the two scales apart and receive a separate legend for both:

````@example secondary_scales
split_spec = spec_a + spec_b * mapping(color = :event => scale(:secondary))
draw(split_spec)
````

Each scale can then be modified separately in the `scales` configuration.
For example, it is not desired that both scales use the same color palette:

````@example secondary_scales
fg = draw(split_spec, scales(secondary = (;
    palette = [:gray70, :gray30]
)))
````

If you don't want to have separate legend groups, you can merge them using the `order` keyword
in the `legend` config.

````@example secondary_scales
draw(
    split_spec,
    scales(
        secondary = (; palette = [:gray70, :gray30])
    );
    legend = (; order = [[:Color, :secondary] => "Legend"])
)
