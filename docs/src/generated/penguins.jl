# # Tutorial 🐧

# This is a gentle and lighthearted tutorial on how to use tools from AlgebraOfGraphics,
# using as example dataset a collection of measurements on penguins[^1]. See 
# the [Palmer penguins website](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/index.html)
# for more information.

# To follow along this tutorial, you will need to install a few packages.
# All the required packages can be installed with the following command.
#
# ```julia
# julia> import Pkg; Pkg.add(["AlgebraOfGraphics", "CairoMakie", "DataFrames", "LIBSVM", "PalmerPenguins"])
# ```
#
# After the above command completes, we are ready to go.
